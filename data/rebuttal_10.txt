 Update:The revision further improved the paper and addressed most of my comments. I am still positive and voting for accepting this paper. **Update**The errors in the paper were fixed, and the discussion was improved.It is very rare to see a novel result as fundamental as the one presented in this paper, and I believe this puts it in the top 5% of accepted papers, so I have updated my score accordingly. I think the discussion and experimentation still has room for improvement, but I am not too bothered, as there do not appear to be any major errors remaining in the paper.
